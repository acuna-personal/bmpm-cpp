// where
//   pattern is a sequence of characters that might appear after a word has been transliterated into phonetic alphabet
//   left context is the context that precedes the pattern
//   right context is the context that follows the pattern
//   phonetic is the result that this rule generates

// note that both left context and right context can be regular expressions
// ex: left context of ^ would mean start of word
//     right context of $ means end of word
//
// match occurs if all of the following are true:
//   portion of word matches the pattern
//   that portion satisfies the context
// A, E, I, O, P, U should create variants, but a, e, i, o, u should not create any new variant
// Q = ü ; Y = ä = ö
